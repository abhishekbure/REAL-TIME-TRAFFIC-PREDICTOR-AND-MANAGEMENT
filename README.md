The **Real-Time Traffic Predictor and Management** project integrates deep learning and reinforcement learning to forecast traffic flow and optimize traffic light control in real-time. Using an LSTM model, the system predicts future traffic volume based on historical sensor data, helping to anticipate congestion. In parallel, a reinforcement learning environment is designed to simulate and manage traffic signals based on predicted congestion levels, aiming to reduce delays and improve vehicle flow. Built with technologies like TensorFlow, Gym, Pandas, Flask, and NumPy, the project also features a RESTful API for making live traffic predictions (`/predict`) and recommending optimal traffic light actions (`/optimize`). This solution is ideal for smart city initiatives focused on intelligent transportation systems, offering scalable and adaptive traffic management capabilities.
